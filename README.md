# Purpose

We wanted to get data from the stack overflow 2024 developer survey specific to Finland, so we can better understand the job market here and make data driven decisions on what technologies to study. We used pandas to filter the data by country so I can make better data driven decisions about what to study, and to exclude anyone without at least a year of professional experience.

Then we graphed the results using matplotlib:
